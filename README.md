This project focuses on predicting temperature trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data. The goal is to capture temporal patterns in historical weather data to forecast future temperature values.

Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
   - Dropped unnecessary columns  
   - Removed null values and duplicates  
   - Visualized temperature trends over time  

2. Preprocessing
   - Data splitting into training and testing sets  
   - Feature scaling (normalization)  
   - Time-series windowing  

3. Modeling  
   - Built and trained an LSTM model  
   - Evaluated model performance on test data
